## Game Structure

### Sequential Challenges
Unlike traditional scavenger hunts, this Amazing Race requires teams to complete challenges **in order**:
- Teams start with only Challenge #1 unlocked
- After completing Challenge #1, Challenge #2 is unlocked
- This continues until all challenges are completed
- The first team to complete all challenges wins!

### Winning Condition
The winner is determined by **who finishes first**, not by points. Teams that complete all challenges are ranked by their finish time.

## Customization

### Adding Custom Commands

Edit `bot.py` and add new command handlers:

```python
async def my_custom_command(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text("Custom response")

# In the run() method:
application.add_handler(CommandHandler("mycommand", self.my_custom_command))
```

### Challenge Verification

The bot supports automatic verification for challenges:

**Photo Challenges:**
- Teams submit photos via Telegram
- Photos are automatically accepted and marked as complete
- Admin receives a copy of each photo submission

**Answer Challenges:**
- Teams submit text answers via the `/submit` command
- Answers are automatically verified against configured expected answers
- Supports exact match or keyword matching
- Case-insensitive comparison

**Customizing Verification:**
You can customize verification logic in the `verify_answer` method in `bot.py`. For example:
- Add location-based verification using GPS coordinates
- Implement time-based challenges
- Add custom answer validation rules

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond
- Check that your bot token is correct in `config.yml`
- Ensure the bot is running (`python bot.py`)
- Check the console for error messages

### Permission errors
- Make sure you're listed in the `admins` section for admin commands
- Verify your user ID is correct

### State issues
- Delete `game_state.json` to reset the game state
- Or use the `/reset` command (admin only)

### Sequential challenge issues
- Make sure challenge IDs in `config.yml` are sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Teams must complete challenges in order - they cannot skip ahead
