## Game Structure

### Sequential Challenges
Unlike traditional scavenger hunts, this Amazing Race requires teams to complete challenges **in order**:
- Teams start with only Challenge #1 unlocked
- After completing Challenge #1, Challenge #2 is unlocked
- This continues until all challenges are completed
- The first team to complete all challenges wins!

### Winning Condition
The winner is determined by **who finishes first**, not by points. Teams that complete all challenges are ranked by their finish time.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram)

## Game Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Admin creates challenges in `config.yml`
   - Players create/join teams using `/createteam` and `/jointeam`

2. **Game Phase**
   - Admin starts the game with `/startgame`
   - Teams complete Challenge #1 first
   - After submitting Challenge #1, Challenge #2 is unlocked
   - Teams continue sequentially through all challenges
   - First team to complete all challenges wins!

3. **End Phase**
   - Admin ends the game with `/endgame`
   - Final leaderboard is displayed
   - Winner is the team that finished first!

## Hints System

The bot supports an optional hints system that allows teams to request help when stuck on a challenge. Each hint comes with a time penalty that delays the next challenge.

### How It Works

1. **Hints Configuration**: Each challenge can have up to 3 hints defined in `config.yml`
2. **Requesting Hints**: Teams use `/hint` to request the next available hint
3. **Confirmation**: Bot asks for confirmation, warning about the 2-minute penalty
4. **Team Broadcast**: When approved, the hint is sent to all team members
5. **Penalty Applied**: When the challenge is completed, a timer delays the next challenge unlock
6. **Maximum Penalty**: With 3 hints used, teams wait 6 minutes before the next challenge

### For Teams

**To request a hint:**
```
/hint
```

The bot will:
- Show any previously used hints
- Ask for confirmation (warns about 2-minute penalty)
- Display current penalty time
- Reveal the hint when confirmed
- Broadcast the hint to all team members

**Viewing hints:**
- `/current` - Shows how many hints are available and which ones you've used
- `/hint` - Shows previously used hints and allows requesting the next one

**Penalty timing:**
When you complete a challenge after using hints, the next challenge will be locked for 2 minutes per hint used. For example:
- 1 hint used = 2 minutes wait
- 2 hints used = 4 minutes wait
- 3 hints used = 6 minutes wait (maximum)

### For Admins

**Configure Hints in config.yml:**
```yaml
challenges:
  - id: 1
    name: "Find the Landmark"
    description: "Take a team photo with the city skyline"
    location: "Downtown Viewpoint"
    type: "photo"
    verification:
      method: "photo"
    hints:
      - "Look for the tallest building in the area"
      - "The viewpoint is near the waterfront"
      - "Check the tourist information center for directions"
```

**Hints are optional:**
- Challenges without hints will show "No hints available" when teams use `/hint`
- You can provide 1, 2, or 3 hints per challenge
- Each hint costs 2 minutes penalty when the next challenge is unlocked

### Hint Strategy

Teams should consider:
- **When to use hints**: Balance speed vs. getting stuck
- **Team coordination**: Any team member can request a hint (all members are notified)
- **Penalty impact**: 6 minutes total penalty can be significant in a close race
- **Progressive difficulty**: Hints are revealed one at a time (can't skip to the last hint)

## Photo Verification for Location Arrival

The bot supports optional photo verification for challenges. You can configure photo verification globally (for all challenges 2+) or per-challenge. When required, teams must send a photo of their team at the challenge location before the challenge details are revealed. This ensures teams physically arrive at each location before knowing what they need to do.

### How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Set photo verification globally with `/togglephotoverify` or per-challenge in `config.yml`
2. **Challenge Progression**: Team completes a challenge and moves to the next one
3. **Photo Required** (if configured): Before challenge details are shown, team must send a photo
4. **Admin Approval**: Admin reviews the photo and approves/rejects it
5. **Challenge Revealed**: Once approved, the full challenge details are revealed to all team members
6. **Timeout Starts**: The penalty timeout (from hints) only starts after photo approval

### Per-Challenge Configuration

You can specify whether photo verification is required for each individual challenge in `config.yml`:

```yaml
challenges:
  - id: 1
    name: "Find the Landmark"
    # Challenge 1 never requires photo verification
    # ...
  
  - id: 2
    name: "Visit the Library"
    requires_photo_verification: true  # Explicitly requires photo
    # ...
  
  - id: 3
    name: "Solve the Riddle"
    requires_photo_verification: false  # Explicitly does NOT require photo
    # ...
  
  - id: 4
    name: "Find the Statue"
    # No field specified - uses global photo_verification_enabled setting
    # ...
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `requires_photo_verification: true` - Challenge requires photo verification regardless of global setting
- `requires_photo_verification: false` - Challenge does NOT require photo verification regardless of global setting
- Field omitted - Challenge uses global `photo_verification_enabled` setting (for challenges 2+)
- Challenge 1 never requires photo verification

**Use Cases:**
- **Location-based challenges**: Set `requires_photo_verification: true` for challenges at specific locations
- **Trivia/puzzle challenges**: Set `requires_photo_verification: false` for challenges that can be completed anywhere
- **Mixed race format**: Combine both types for a dynamic race experience

### For Teams

**When you advance to a challenge that requires photo verification:**

1. You'll see a message indicating photo verification is required
2. Go to the challenge location (only the name and location are shown)
3. Take a photo of your team at that location
4. Send the photo to the bot
5. Wait for admin approval
6. Once approved, the full challenge details will be revealed
7. Complete the challenge as normal

**Important Notes:**
- Challenge 1 never requires photo verification (it's the starting point)
- Only challenges configured with photo verification will require it
- Any team member can send the photo
- The photo must show your team at the location
- The timeout/penalty timer only starts after the photo is approved

### For Admins

**Global Toggle:**
```
/togglephotoverify
```
This enables or disables photo verification globally. Challenges without explicit `requires_photo_verification` settings will follow this global setting.

**Per-Challenge Override:**
Configure `requires_photo_verification: true` or `false` in `config.yml` for any challenge to override the global setting.

**Approving Photos:**
When a team sends a location photo:
1. You'll receive the photo with the team name and challenge number
2. Review the photo to verify the team is at the correct location
3. Click ‚úÖ **Approve** to reveal the challenge to the team
4. Click ‚ùå **Reject** if the photo is incorrect (team can resubmit)

**Managing Multiple Teams:**
- Multiple teams can have pending photo verifications simultaneously
- Each photo shows which team and challenge it's for
- Use the inline buttons on each photo to approve/reject
- Use `/approve` to see a list of all pending verifications

**Tips:**
- Review photos promptly to keep the game flowing
- Be clear about why photos are rejected (team can send a new one)
- Photo verification adds an extra layer of fairness to the race
- The timeout/penalty timer starts only after you approve the photo
- Use per-challenge configuration for maximum flexibility

### Privacy Considerations

- Photos are only used for verification during the game
- Photos are stored temporarily in the game state
- Teams control when they send photos
- Photo verification can be disabled at any time by the admin

## Configuration

Edit `config.yml` to customize your game:

```yaml
game:
  name: "AmazingRaceBot"
  max_teams: 10
  max_team_size: 5
  
  challenges:
    - id: 1
      name: "Challenge Name"
      description: "What teams need to do"
      location: "Where to go"
      type: "photo"  # Challenge type (photo, riddle, code, qr, trivia, etc.)
      verification:
        method: "photo"  # Verification method (photo or answer)
      hints:  # Optional: up to 3 hints per challenge
        - "First hint (easier)"
        - "Second hint (more specific)"
        - "Third hint (almost gives it away)"
    
    - id: 2

        Debug this function and submit the output for fib(5):
        def fib(n):
            if n <= 1: return 1  # Bug here!
            return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
      location: "Computer Lab"
      type: "code"
      verification:
        method: "answer"
        # Multiple acceptable answer formats for flexibility
        acceptable_answers:
          - "5"
          - "five"
          - "answer is 5"
    
    - id: 4
      name: "Trivia Challenge"
      description: "Name three programming languages"

      # No hints - this challenge is optional without hints
    
    - id: 5
      name: "Capital Cities Checklist"
      description: "Name 5 capital cities from different continents"
      location: "Anywhere"
      type: "trivia"
      verification:
        method: "answer"
        # Checklist mode: participants can submit items one at a time or all at once
        checklist_items:
          - "Tokyo"
          - "Paris"
          - "Cairo"
          - "Brasilia"
          - "Canberra"
      hints:
        - "Think about each continent: Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, Australia"
```

### Challenge Configuration Fields

- **id**: Unique challenge number (sequential: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **name**: Display name of the challenge
- **description**: Instructions for the challenge
- **location**: Where the challenge takes place
- **type**: Challenge type (photo, riddle, code, qr, trivia, scavenger, team_activity, decryption, text)
- **verification**: Verification configuration
  - **method**: "photo" or "answer"
  - **answer**: (for answer method) Expected answer or comma-separated keywords (for trivia)
  - **acceptable_answers**: (for answer method) List of acceptable answers - any one matches (for code challenges)
  - **checklist_items**: (for answer method) List of items that can be submitted individually
    - Enables progressive answering - teams can submit items one at a time
    - Each item is tracked independently
    - Challenge completes when all items are submitted
    - Items are matched case-insensitively using substring matching
- **requires_photo_verification**: (optional) Boolean to control photo verification for this challenge
  - `true` - Requires photo verification regardless of global setting
  - `false` - Does NOT require photo verification regardless of global setting
  - Omitted - Uses global `photo_verification_enabled` setting (for challenges 2+)
  - Note: Challenge 1 never requires photo verification
- **hints**: (optional) List of up to 3 hints for the challenge
  - Each hint costs 2 minutes penalty (max 6 minutes total)
  - Hints are revealed sequentially (one at a time)
  - Teams can request hints using `/hint`

**Note**: Challenges are completed sequentially based on their ID order (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Checklist Challenges

Checklist challenges allow teams to submit answers progressively instead of all at once. This is perfect for:
- Multi-part questions (e.g., "Name 5 capital cities")
- Collection tasks (e.g., "List 3 programming languages")
- Enumeration challenges (e.g., "Name the 7 continents")

**How it works:**
1. Configure a challenge with `checklist_items` instead of `answer`
2. Teams can submit answers one at a time: `/submit Tokyo`
3. Bot tracks progress and shows which items are completed
4. Teams can also submit multiple items: `/submit Tokyo Paris` or `/submit Tokyo and Paris`
5. Challenge completes when all items are submitted

**Example:**
```yaml
- id: 5
  name: "Programming Languages"
  description: "Name 3 popular programming languages"
  location: "Anywhere"
  type: "trivia"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    checklist_items:
      - "Python"
      - "JavaScript"
      - "Java"
```

**Benefits:**
- Teams can make progress even if they don't know all answers
- Encourages teamwork as members can contribute different items
- Progress is visible, showing which items remain
- More engaging and interactive than all-or-nothing answers

**Admin Commands for Photo Management:**
- `/approve` - View list of all pending photo submissions
- `/reject` - View list of all pending photo submissions (same as approve)
- Use the inline buttons on photo messages to approve/reject

**Tips:**
- Review photos promptly to keep the game flowing
- Be clear about rejection reasons (teams can resubmit)
- Use the submission ID in the photo caption to track submissions

## Customization

### Adding Custom Commands

Edit `bot.py` and add new command handlers:

```python
async def my_custom_command(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text("Custom response")

# In the run() method:
application.add_handler(CommandHandler("mycommand", self.my_custom_command))
```

### Challenge Verification

The bot supports automatic verification for challenges:

**Photo Challenges:**
- Teams submit photos via Telegram
- Photos are sent to the admin for approval
- Admin can approve or reject submissions using inline buttons
- After approval, challenge is marked as complete
- Team members are notified when their photo is approved or rejected

**Answer Challenges:**
- Teams submit text answers via the `/submit` command
- Answers are automatically verified against configured expected answers
- Supports exact match or keyword matching
- Case-insensitive comparison

**Customizing Verification:**
You can customize verification logic in the `verify_answer` method in `bot.py`. The bot includes:
- **Answer verification**: Exact match or keyword matching (case-insensitive)
- **Photo verification**: Manual admin approval with notification

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond
- Check that your bot token is correct in `config.yml`
- Ensure the bot is running (`python bot.py`)
- Check the console for error messages

### Permission errors
- Make sure you're listed in the `admins` section for admin commands
- Verify your user ID is correct

### State issues
- Delete `game_state.json` to reset the game state
- Or use the `/reset` command (admin only)

### Sequential challenge issues
- Make sure challenge IDs in `config.yml` are sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Teams must complete challenges in order - they cannot skip ahead
