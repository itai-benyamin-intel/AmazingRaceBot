## Game Structure

### Sequential Challenges
Unlike traditional scavenger hunts, this Amazing Race requires teams to complete challenges **in order**:
- Teams start with only Challenge #1 unlocked
- After completing Challenge #1, Challenge #2 is unlocked
- This continues until all challenges are completed
- The first team to complete all challenges wins!

### Winning Condition
The winner is determined by **who finishes first**, not by points. Teams that complete all challenges are ranked by their finish time.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itai-benyamin-intel/uCodeAmazingRace.git
cd uCodeAmazingRace
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create your configuration file:
```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

4. Edit `config.yml` and add your Telegram bot token:
```yaml

  bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

5. Customize the challenges and game settings in `config.yml`

6. Add your Telegram user ID to the admin field in `config.yml`:
   - To find your user ID, message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
   - Note: Only one admin is supported

### Running the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will start and be ready to receive commands!

## Usage

- `/myteam` - View your team's information and progress
- `/challenges` - View completed challenges and your current challenge
- `/current_challenge` - View your current challenge (shows available/used hints)

## Game Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Admin creates challenges in `config.yml`
   - Players create/join teams using `/createteam` and `/jointeam`

2. **Game Phase**
   - Admin starts the game with `/startgame`
   - Teams complete Challenge #1 first
   - After submitting Challenge #1, Challenge #2 is unlocked
   - Teams continue sequentially through all challenges
   - First team to complete all challenges wins!

3. **End Phase**
   - Admin ends the game with `/endgame`
   - Final leaderboard is displayed
   - Winner is the team that finished first!

## Hints System

The bot supports an optional hints system that allows teams to request help when stuck on a challenge. Each hint comes with a time penalty that delays the next challenge.

### How It Works

1. **Hints Configuration**: Each challenge can have up to 3 hints defined in `config.yml`
2. **Requesting Hints**: Teams use `/hint` to request the next available hint
3. **Confirmation**: Bot asks for confirmation, warning about the 2-minute penalty
4. **Team Broadcast**: When approved, the hint is sent to all team members
5. **Penalty Applied**: When the challenge is completed, a timer delays the next challenge unlock
6. **Maximum Penalty**: With 3 hints used, teams wait 6 minutes before the next challenge

### For Teams

**To request a hint:**
```
/hint
```

The bot will:
- Show any previously used hints
- Ask for confirmation (warns about 2-minute penalty)
- Display current penalty time
- Reveal the hint when confirmed
- Broadcast the hint to all team members

**Viewing hints:**
- `/current_challenge` - Shows how many hints are available and which ones you've used
- `/hint` - Shows previously used hints and allows requesting the next one

**Penalty timing:**
When you complete a challenge after using hints, the next challenge will be locked for 2 minutes per hint used. For example:
- 1 hint used = 2 minutes wait
- 2 hints used = 4 minutes wait
- 3 hints used = 6 minutes wait (maximum)

### For Admins

**Configure Hints in config.yml:**
```yaml
challenges:
  - id: 1
    name: "Find the Landmark"
    description: "Take a team photo with the city skyline"
    location: "Downtown Viewpoint"
    type: "photo"
    verification:
      method: "photo"
    hints:
      - "Look for the tallest building in the area"
      - "The viewpoint is near the waterfront"
      - "Check the tourist information center for directions"
```

**Hints are optional:**
- Challenges without hints will show "No hints available" when teams use `/hint`
- You can provide 1, 2, or 3 hints per challenge
- Each hint costs 2 minutes penalty when the next challenge is unlocked

### Hint Strategy

Teams should consider:
- **When to use hints**: Balance speed vs. getting stuck
- **Team coordination**: Any team member can request a hint (all members are notified)
- **Penalty impact**: 6 minutes total penalty can be significant in a close race
- **Progressive difficulty**: Hints are revealed one at a time (can't skip to the last hint)

## Location-Based Verification

The bot supports optional GPS-based location verification for challenges. When enabled, teams must physically be at the challenge location (within a specified radius) before they can submit their answer.

### How It Works

1. **Enable/Disable**: Admin can toggle location verification using `/togglelocation`
2. **Location Verification**: Teams share their GPS location using Telegram's location attachment
3. **Distance Check**: Bot calculates distance using the Haversine formula
4. **Radius Verification**: Team must be within the configured radius (default: 100m)
5. **Challenge 1 Exception**: Location verification is skipped for Challenge 1 (starting point)

### For Teams

To share your location:
1. In the chat, tap the attachment button (üìé)
2. Select "Location"
3. Choose "Send My Current Location"
4. Wait for the bot to verify your location
5. Once verified, submit your challenge answer

### For Admins

**Toggle Location Verification:**
```
/togglelocation
```
This enables or disables location verification for all challenges (except Challenge 1).

**Configure Challenge Coordinates in config.yml:**
```yaml
game:
  location_verification_enabled: true  # Enable on startup
  
  challenges:
    - id: 2
      name: "Library Challenge"
      # ... other fields ...
      coordinates:
        latitude: 37.7749
        longitude: -122.4194
        radius: 100  # meters
```

### Privacy Considerations

- Location data is only used for verification during the game
- Locations are stored temporarily in the game state
- Teams can choose to share their location only when needed
- Location verification can be disabled at any time by the admin

## Configuration

Edit `config.yml` to customize your game:

```yaml

- Or use the `/reset` command (admin only)

### Sequential challenge issues
- Make sure challenge IDs in `config.yml` are sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Teams must complete challenges in order - they cannot skip ahead
