# Challenge Types Guide

This document provides detailed information about the challenge types system in the AmazingRaceBot.

## Overview

The challenge types system allows you to create diverse, engaging challenges with automatic verification. Each challenge type has specific characteristics and verification methods.

## Challenge Types

### 1. üì∑ Photo Challenge

Teams take photos of specified objects, landmarks, or complete specific scenes.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 1
  name: "Team Photo at Landmark"
  description: "Take a team photo with the city skyline in the background"
  location: "Downtown Viewpoint"
  type: "photo"
  verification:
    method: "photo"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams use `/submit 1` to initiate submission
- Bot prompts them to send a photo
- Teams send the photo via Telegram
- Photo is sent to admin for approval
- Admin approves or rejects using inline buttons
- Challenge is marked complete after admin approval
- Team is notified of approval/rejection

**Use cases:**
- Team photos at specific locations
- Photos of completed puzzles
- Documentation of found items
- Creative team compositions

### 2. üß© Riddle/Clue Challenge

Teams solve riddles or puzzles to determine answers or next locations.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 2
  name: "Library Riddle"
  description: "I stand tall where knowledge flows, students gather in my shadow's throes. What am I?"
  location: "Campus"
  type: "riddle"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "library"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams read the riddle in their challenge list
- They solve the riddle
- Use `/submit 2 library` to submit their answer
- Bot automatically verifies if the answer matches (case-insensitive)

**Answer matching:**
- Exact match: `library` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Case-insensitive: `LIBRARY` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Keyword match: `the library building` contains `library` ‚úÖ

### 3. üíª Code Challenge

Teams write or debug code to solve a specific problem.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 3
  name: "Fix the Bug"
  description: "Fix this function to correctly calculate Fibonacci numbers. Submit the keyword that appears in the correct solution."
  location: "Computer Lab"
  type: "code"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "fibonacci"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams work on the coding problem
- Submit their answer or a keyword from their solution
- Bot verifies the submission

**Tips:**
- For code challenges, you can ask teams to submit:
  - The result of running their code
  - A specific keyword that appears in the correct solution
  - The function name
  - A hash of their code

### 4. üì± QR Hunt Challenge

Teams find and scan hidden QR codes at locations.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 4
  name: "Hidden QR Code"
  description: "Find the QR code hidden near the water fountain"
  location: "Main Courtyard"
  type: "qr"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "FOUNTAIN_2024"
```

**How it works:**

- Teams scan the QR code with any QR scanner app
- They submit the text from the QR code: `/submit 4 FOUNTAIN_2024`
- Bot verifies the code matches

**QR Code Setup:**
- Use online QR code generators

  location: "Anywhere"
  type: "trivia"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "turing, lovelace, babbage"
```

**How it works:**

## Verification Methods

### Photo Verification

```yaml
verification:
  method: "photo"
```

- Teams submit photos via Telegram
- Photos are sent to admin for approval
- Admin receives photo with approve/reject buttons
- Challenge is marked complete after admin approval
- Team members are notified of approval/rejection

### Answer Verification

```yaml
verification:
  method: "answer"
  answer: "expected_answer"
```

**Single keyword:**
- Checks if the expected answer appears in the user's answer
- Case-insensitive matching
- Example: `answer: "keyboard"` matches "The answer is keyboard"

**Multiple keywords (trivia):**
- Use comma-separated keywords
- ALL keywords must be present in the user's answer
- Example: `answer: "python, java, javascript"`

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Challenges

1. **Clear Instructions**: Make challenge descriptions clear and unambiguous
2. **Appropriate Difficulty**: Mix easy and hard challenges to keep teams engaged
3. **Variety**: Use different challenge types to keep the race interesting
4. **Testing**: Test your challenges before the event
5. **Backup Plans**: Have alternatives ready in case of technical issues

### Answer Configuration

1. **Use lowercase**: Always use lowercase in the `answer` field
2. **Simple answers**: Keep expected answers simple and clear
3. **Keywords**: For trivia, use distinctive keywords that are unlikely to appear by accident
4. **Test verification**: Test answer matching with various inputs

### Photo Challenges

1. **Specific requirements**: Be clear about what should be in the photo
2. **Safe locations**: Ensure photo locations are safe and accessible
3. **Legal considerations**: Ensure photos don't violate privacy or property rules
4. **Admin approval**: Admins must approve all photo submissions before challenges are marked complete
5. **Timely review**: Admins should review and approve/reject photos promptly to keep the game flowing

## Example Challenge Set

Here's a complete example of a diverse challenge set:

```yaml

    type: "decryption"
    verification:
      method: "answer"
      answer: "finish"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Teams can't submit answers
- Check that the game has started (`/startgame`)
- Verify they're submitting the current challenge (sequential order)
- Ensure answer format is correct

### Answer not being accepted
- Check for typos in the config `answer` field
- Remember answers are case-insensitive
- For trivia, ensure all keywords are present

### Photos not working
- Ensure teams send photos (not files or documents)
- Check that bot has permission to receive photos
- Verify network connectivity

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the challenge types system:

1. **Location Verification**: GPS-based automatic location checking
2. **Time Challenges**: Challenges that must be completed within a time limit
3. **Team Collaboration**: Challenges requiring multiple team submissions
4. **Puzzle Pieces**: Challenges that unlock parts of a larger puzzle
5. **Bonus Challenges**: Optional challenges for extra achievements
6. **Manual Approval**: Admin review workflow for subjective challenges
