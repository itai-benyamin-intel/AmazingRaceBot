# Challenge Types Guide

This document provides detailed information about the challenge types system in the AmazingRaceBot.

## Overview

The challenge types system allows you to create diverse, engaging challenges with automatic verification. Each challenge type has specific characteristics and verification methods.

## Challenge Types

### 1. üì∑ Photo Challenge

Teams take photos of specified objects, landmarks, or complete specific scenes.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 1
  name: "Team Photo at Landmark"
  description: "Take a team photo with the city skyline in the background"
  location: "Downtown Viewpoint"
  type: "photo"
  verification:
    method: "photo"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams use `/submit 1` to initiate submission
- Bot prompts them to send a photo
- Teams send the photo via Telegram
- Photo is sent to admin for approval
- Admin approves or rejects using inline buttons
- Challenge is marked complete after admin approval
- Team is notified of approval/rejection

**Use cases:**
- Team photos at specific locations
- Photos of completed puzzles
- Documentation of found items
- Creative team compositions

### 2. üß© Riddle/Clue Challenge

Teams solve riddles or puzzles to determine answers or next locations.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 2
  name: "Library Riddle"
  description: "I stand tall where knowledge flows, students gather in my shadow's throes. What am I?"
  location: "Campus"
  type: "riddle"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "library"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams read the riddle in their challenge list
- They solve the riddle
- Use `/submit 2 library` to submit their answer
- Bot automatically verifies if the answer matches (case-insensitive)

**Answer matching:**
- Exact match: `library` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Case-insensitive: `LIBRARY` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Keyword match: `the library building` contains `library` ‚úÖ

---

### 3. üíª Code Challenge

Teams write or debug code to solve a specific problem.

**Configuration Example (Recommended - Multiple Acceptable Answers):**
```yaml
- id: 3
  name: "Fibonacci Calculator"
  description: |
    Fix this Python function to correctly calculate Fibonacci numbers:
    
    def fib(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return 1  # Bug: should return n
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    
    What should fib(5) return? Submit the correct result.
  location: "Computer Lab"
  type: "code"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    # List multiple acceptable answer formats
    acceptable_answers:
      - "5"              # Just the number
      - "five"           # Written out
      - "answer is 5"    # In a sentence
```

**Configuration Example (Simple - Single Keyword):**
```yaml
- id: 3
  name: "Code Challenge"
  description: "Write a function called 'fibonacci' that calculates Fibonacci numbers."
  location: "Computer Lab"
  type: "code"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "fibonacci"  # Checks if answer contains this keyword
```

**How it works:**
- Teams work on the coding problem
- Submit their answer using `/submit 3 <answer>`
- Bot verifies the submission against acceptable answers or keywords

**Verification Options:**

1. **Multiple Acceptable Answers** (Recommended for code challenges):
   ```yaml
   verification:
     method: "answer"
     acceptable_answers:
       - "42"
       - "forty-two"
       - "result: 42"
   ```
   - Accepts ANY one of the listed answers
   - Each answer can be an exact match OR contained in the submission
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Best for code output verification

2. **Single Keyword** (Simple approach):
   ```yaml
   verification:
     method: "answer"
     answer: "fibonacci"
   ```
   - Checks if the keyword appears in the answer
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Good for function names or simple validation

**Best Practices for Code Challenges:**
- **Ask for outputs**, not code: "What does this function return?" is easier to verify than code itself
- **Use acceptable_answers** for flexibility: Allow different formats (numeric, written, etc.)
- **Provide clear examples**: Show the exact input/output expected
- **Consider edge cases**: Include common variations in acceptable_answers
- **Test your verification**: Try different answer formats before the event

**Example Use Cases:**
1. **Bug Fix Challenge**: Find and fix a bug, submit the corrected output
2. **Algorithm Challenge**: Implement an algorithm, submit the result for a test case
3. **Code Reading**: Analyze code and predict the output
4. **Function Naming**: Write code with a specific function name (keyword verification)

### 4. üì± QR Hunt Challenge

Teams find and scan hidden QR codes at locations.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 4
  name: "Hidden QR Code"
  description: "Find the QR code hidden near the water fountain"
  location: "Main Courtyard"
  type: "qr"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "FOUNTAIN_2024"
```

**How it works:**
- Place QR codes containing specific text at locations
- Teams scan the QR code with any QR scanner app
- They submit the text from the QR code: `/submit 4 FOUNTAIN_2024`
- Bot verifies the code matches

**QR Code Setup:**
- Use online QR code generators
- Encode a unique text string for each location
- Print and place at challenge locations
- Update the `answer` field with the encoded text

  description: "Name three inventors who contributed to the development of the modern computer"
  location: "Anywhere"
  type: "trivia"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "turing, lovelace, babbage"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams answer the trivia question
- Submit with `/submit 5 Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage`
- Bot checks if ALL required keywords are present in the answer

**Multiple keyword verification:**
- Answer must contain ALL keywords (comma-separated in config)
- Order doesn't matter
- Case-insensitive
- Example: `answer: "python, java, javascript"`
  - `"I know Python, JavaScript, and Java"` ‚úÖ
  - `"Python and Java"` ‚ùå (missing JavaScript)
