# Challenge Types Guide

This document provides detailed information about the challenge types system in the AmazingRaceBot.

## Overview

The challenge types system allows you to create diverse, engaging challenges with automatic verification. Each challenge type has specific characteristics and verification methods.

## Challenge Types

### 1. üì∑ Photo Challenge

Teams take photos of specified objects, landmarks, or complete specific scenes.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 1
  name: "Team Photo at Landmark"
  description: "Take a team photo with the city skyline in the background"
  location: "Downtown Viewpoint"
  type: "photo"
  verification:
    method: "photo"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams use `/submit 1` to initiate submission
- Bot prompts them to send a photo
- Teams send the photo via Telegram
- Photo is sent to admin for approval
- Admin approves or rejects using inline buttons
- Challenge is marked complete after admin approval
- Team is notified of approval/rejection

**Use cases:**
- Team photos at specific locations
- Photos of completed puzzles
- Documentation of found items
- Creative team compositions

### 2. üß© Riddle/Clue Challenge

Teams solve riddles or puzzles to determine answers or next locations.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 2
  name: "Library Riddle"
  description: "I stand tall where knowledge flows, students gather in my shadow's throes. What am I?"
  location: "Campus"
  type: "riddle"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "library"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams read the riddle in their challenge list
- They solve the riddle
- Use `/submit 2 library` to submit their answer
- Bot automatically verifies if the answer matches (case-insensitive)

**Answer matching:**
- Exact match: `library` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Case-insensitive: `LIBRARY` = `library` ‚úÖ
- Keyword match: `the library building` contains `library` ‚úÖ

---

### 3. üíª Code Challenge

Teams write or debug code to solve a specific problem.

**Configuration Example (Recommended - Multiple Acceptable Answers):**
```yaml
- id: 3
  name: "Fibonacci Calculator"
  description: |
    Fix this Python function to correctly calculate Fibonacci numbers:
    
    def fib(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return 1  # Bug: should return n
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    
    What should fib(5) return? Submit the correct result.
  location: "Computer Lab"
  type: "code"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    # List multiple acceptable answer formats
    acceptable_answers:
      - "5"              # Just the number
      - "five"           # Written out
      - "answer is 5"    # In a sentence
```

**Configuration Example (Simple - Single Keyword):**
```yaml
- id: 3
  name: "Code Challenge"
  description: "Write a function called 'fibonacci' that calculates Fibonacci numbers."
  location: "Computer Lab"
  type: "code"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "fibonacci"  # Checks if answer contains this keyword
```

**How it works:**
- Teams work on the coding problem
- Submit their answer using `/submit 3 <answer>`
- Bot verifies the submission against acceptable answers or keywords

**Verification Options:**

1. **Multiple Acceptable Answers** (Recommended for code challenges):
   ```yaml
   verification:
     method: "answer"
     acceptable_answers:
       - "42"
       - "forty-two"
       - "result: 42"
   ```
   - Accepts ANY one of the listed answers
   - Each answer can be an exact match OR contained in the submission
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Best for code output verification

2. **Single Keyword** (Simple approach):
   ```yaml
   verification:
     method: "answer"
     answer: "fibonacci"
   ```
   - Checks if the keyword appears in the answer
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Good for function names or simple validation

**Best Practices for Code Challenges:**
- **Ask for outputs**, not code: "What does this function return?" is easier to verify than code itself
- **Use acceptable_answers** for flexibility: Allow different formats (numeric, written, etc.)
- **Provide clear examples**: Show the exact input/output expected
- **Consider edge cases**: Include common variations in acceptable_answers
- **Test your verification**: Try different answer formats before the event

**Example Use Cases:**
1. **Bug Fix Challenge**: Find and fix a bug, submit the corrected output
2. **Algorithm Challenge**: Implement an algorithm, submit the result for a test case
3. **Code Reading**: Analyze code and predict the output
4. **Function Naming**: Write code with a specific function name (keyword verification)

### 4. ‚ùì Multi Choice Challenge

Teams answer questions related to specific topics.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 4
  name: "Tech Multi Choice"
  description: "Name three inventors who contributed to the development of the modern computer"
  location: "Anywhere"
  type: "multi_choice"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "turing, lovelace, babbage"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams answer the multi choice question
- Submit with `/submit 4 Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage`
- Bot checks if ALL required keywords are present in the answer

**Multiple keyword verification:**
- Answer must contain ALL keywords (comma-separated in config)
- Order doesn't matter
- Case-insensitive
- Example: `answer: "python, java, javascript"`
  - `"I know Python, JavaScript, and Java"` ‚úÖ
  - `"Python and Java"` ‚ùå (missing JavaScript)

### 5. üîç Scavenger Hunt Challenge

Teams find and document specific items.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 5
  name: "Transportation Hunt"
  description: "Find and photograph 5 different types of transportation in the area"
  location: "Campus Area"
  type: "scavenger"
  verification:
    method: "photo"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams search for the required items
- Take photos as proof
- Submit photo via `/submit 5` then send the photo
- Can be used for single items or collections

### 6. ü§ù Team Activity Challenge

Teams perform a specific activity together.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 6
  name: "Human Pyramid"
  description: "Create a human pyramid with your team"
  location: "Outdoor Area"
  type: "team_activity"
  verification:
    method: "photo"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams perform the activity together
- Take a photo as proof
- Submit via `/submit 6` then send the photo

**Activity ideas:**
- Human pyramids
- Group poses
- Synchronized actions
- Creative formations

  name: "Caesar Cipher"
  description: "Decode this Caesar cipher (shift 3): Frqjudwxodwlrqv"
  location: "Anywhere"
  type: "decryption"
  verification:
    method: "answer"
    answer: "congratulations"
```

**How it works:**
- Teams receive an encoded message
- They decrypt it using the specified method
- Submit the decrypted message

**Encryption methods:**

### 8. üèÜ Tournament Challenge

Teams compete in bracket-style tournaments where they face off against each other in games or competitions.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
- id: 8
  name: "Amazing Race Tournament"
  description: "Teams will compete in a tournament-style rock-paper-scissors championship"
  location: "Arena"
  type: "tournament"
  verification:
    method: "tournament"
  tournament:
    game_name: "Rock Paper Scissors"
    timeout_minutes: 5  # Penalty for last place (optional, defaults to 5)
```

**How it works:**
- When teams reach this challenge, they are entered into a tournament bracket
- The bot automatically generates randomized matchups
- Teams compete in parallel (all matches in a round happen simultaneously)
- Admin reports match winners using `/tournamentwin <challenge_id> <team_name>`
- Winners advance to the next round
- Losers compete in subsequent consolation rounds to determine final rankings
- The last-place team receives a timeout penalty before the next challenge

**Tournament Flow:**
1. **Bracket Generation**: When the first team reaches the challenge, the bot creates a randomized bracket
2. **Round Announcements**: The bot announces pairings for each round
3. **Match Reporting**: Admin observes matches and reports winners
4. **Advancement**: Winners move to the next round, losers to consolation brackets
5. **Final Rankings**: Tournament continues until all positions are determined
6. **Penalty Application**: Last-place team gets a timeout before next challenge unlocks

**Handling Odd Numbers:**
- If there's an odd number of teams, one team receives a bye (automatic advancement)
- Byes are assigned to maintain bracket balance

**Admin Commands:**
- `/tournamentwin <challenge_id> <team_name>` - Report match winner
- `/tournamentstatus <challenge_id>` - View current tournament state
- `/tournamentreset <challenge_id>` - Reset tournament (if needed)

**Use cases:**
- Physical competitions (sports, games)
- Multi choice contests
- Skill challenges
- Creative competitions
- Any head-to-head format
